The movie, Olivia Wilde’s next feature directorial project after Booksmart, made a first impression so appealing that 18 studios competed to buy it in 2019, including winner New Line Cinema. Yet over the past three years, the movie has been plagued by reports of alleged behind-the-scenes drama.

In this community, women are expected to stay inside while men go work on a mysterious project helmed by a suspicious-looking Chris Pine. Wilde marketed Don’t Worry Darling as a rare showcase of “female pleasure” and seemed to frame the production itself as an empowering workplace — one where her “no assholes” rule could cause LaBeouf’s exit in order to protect Pugh. Below, a timeline of events as audiences became more and more worried about Don’t Worry, Darling, from Wilde’s alleged on-set romance with Styles to a leaked video of her asking LaBeouf if he’d come back if Pugh “really commits.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl7hw89vs002d3b6rxek4abby@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Making (and breaking) a cast</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7hw8tqh002l3b6r17h370zv@published data-word-count=73><strong>April 24, 2020: </strong>Florence Pugh is announced as the lead housewife of Don’t Worry Darling. <a href=#>According to Deadline</a>, the movie will be set in an isolated, seemingly utopian community — not exactly a foreign concept to Pugh, who is coming off a star turn in <a href=#>Midsommar</a>.

(“I mean, there’s a reason I left that relationship.”) Wilde indirectly comments on rumors of Pugh’s frustration with the director’s on-set relationship with Styles, noting that she believes the tabloid media “is a tool to pit women against one another and to shame them.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7hwb6ma005f3b6ri1dge3yp@published data-word-count=81>Pugh declines to be interviewed for the story, and her publicist tells Variety that she is busy filming Dune: Part Two.
