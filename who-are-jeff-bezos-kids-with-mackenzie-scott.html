After their divorce was finalized, she became the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">second-richest woman in the US</a> and got remarried in 2021. She is also <a href=#>one of the most charitable billionaires</a>, giving significant portions of her divorce settlement to charity.</p><p>MacKenzie Scott is a writer who supported her husband's Amazon venture from day one and stood by him in the difficult early days before the business became the most dominant player in the e-commerce industry. She was very involved in raising their four children and put her career plans on hold to do it.</p><p>During their lengthy marriage, MacKenzie and Jeff became parents to four children, three sons and a daughter. However, only the name of one of them is known and none of their birth dates are public.</p><p>Despite her loyalty, the marriage started to falter after Jeff Bezos met and started an affair with Lauren Sanchez, a married TV anchor whom <a href=#>he met through her husband</a> in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>MacKenzie Scott & Jeff Bezos: 10 Biggest Celebrity Divorce Settlements</a></span></p><p>This obsessive need for privacy seems supported by both parents, but fans can only speculate about why Jeff Bezos is so keen on protecting his children. While other super-rich parents are also trying to raise their children outside the public's eye, Jeff seems to take it to another level.</p><p>It is possible that he fears that his status as a "super-villain," cemented by Amazon's predatory reputation, may rub onto the children and make them subject to bullying and cruelty from their peers.</p><p>This hypothesis is supported by the fact that he is a doting father who encourages his children to pursue their passions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the divorce, he is co-parenting his four children and is likely to continue his close relationship with them for the foreseeable future. In 2018, he expressed how he felt about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spending time with his children</a>, saying, "I like to read the newspaper, I like to have coffee, I like to have breakfast with my kids before they go to school," he said.</p><h2 id=who-are-jeff-bezos-39-kids>Who Are Jeff Bezos' Kids?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar51892119-1.jpg><p>Not much is known about the Bezos children. Jeff and MacKenzie's oldest son was born in 2000, and was named Preston after his dad (Jeffrey Preston Bezos). He has made rare appearances with his family and father in public and also told his dad to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"not F up The Lord of The Rings: The Rings of Power"</a> when Amazon got involved with the project.</p><p>Bezos admitted his son was right and made him understand the value of the movie for him and the audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Elon Musk Have A Relationship With His Oldest Kids?</a></span></p><p>A lot less is known about Jeff Bezos' other two sons. Other than making an appearance with their parents at a movie opening event in 2016, they have been kept completely away from the limelight. Jeff and MacKenzie's daughter is adopted and was born in China, but that is all fans know about her.</p><p>Speaking about his children, Bezos shared the wisdom he would like to instill in them. He wants them to pursue their own dreams rather than follow in his footsteps, saying, "Whatever you do, choose something you can bring passion to. You've got to figure out what you love. And it's going to bring you great joy."</p><h2 id=jeff-bezos-doesn-39-t-keep-his-fianc-eacute-e-39-s-son-anonymous>Jeff Bezos Doesn't Keep His FiancÃ©e's Son Anonymous</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lauren-sanchez-s-son-nikko-gonzalez-is-living-as-lavish-of-a-life-as-jeff-bezos-all-three-please-here-is-nikko.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike his own children, Jeff Bezos does not appear <a href=#>concerned with his soon-to-be stepson's privacy</a>. Lauren Sanchez shares a son, Nikko, with Football Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez.</p><p>Nikko uses his social media to document his life, something that Bezos's own children do not do. He seems to travel extensively and loves skiing. He has also been linked with Instagram influencer Ginebra, but not much is known about his love life or relationships.</p><p>However, this is a wealth of information if we compare it with the precious little fans know about Jeff Bezos' own children.</p><p>When he eventually marries Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos will also become step-father to her two children with ex-husband Patrick Whitesell. Evan and Eleanor are young enough that their parents may not want to give them much public exposure but as they grow older they may follow in the footsteps of Nikko and be allowed the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, while fans don't have access to much information about the very private Bezos children, they can follow the very public relationship Jeff enjoys with Lauren Sanchez and the exploits of her son, Nikko.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecmenZ9lkprHsL%2BMpKCdq12strW0jKaYnKOVo8eqsYysmqispGQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./agt-wyn-starks-audition-season-17-episode-7-recap.html>&#171;&nbsp;Wyn Starks Is An Instant Frontrunner After His Audition Hollywood Life</a>
