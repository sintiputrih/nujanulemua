So it's not surprising that her friend group consists of some of the most famous Gen Z personalities. Perhaps the one that stands out the most is Olivia Rodrigo, who is probably her best friend in the world, but she's close to lots of artists and public personalities.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Iris And Maude Apatow's Life As Adults, Revealed</a></span>This article will dive into Iris Apatow's closest celebrity friendships, what they share, and what these friends are famous for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=talia-ryder><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Talia Ryder</span></h2><p>Among the many famous friends Iris Apatow keeps is Talia Ryder, a young star that rose to stardom not too long ago, and has done many incredible things ever since. Her breakthrough role was as Hortensia in the Broadway cast of Matilda the Musical, and she recently starred as Skylar in the 2020 movie Never Rarely Sometimes Always. She will be starring in the upcoming film Hello, Goodbye, and Everything In Between, a movie based on Jennifer E. Smith's novel by the same name, that will come out in just a couple of months. Iris has posted several pictures with Talia, and they're obviously close. While it's not known how she and Iris met, Talia appeared in Olivia Rodrigo's music video for "Deja Vu", so they might have connected through the singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=avani-gregg><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Avani Gregg</span></h2><p>Avani Gregg has only recently become famous, but despite being very young, she has managed to use her exposure and take control of her image to do whatever she wants to do with her platform. She first went viral in 2019 on a TikTok video where she did a Harley Quinn-style makeup session. She has since become a professional makeup artist and joined the LA-based collective for TikTok creators called The Hype House along with Charli D'Amelio. Iris has been seen many times with both Charli and Avani, along with Olivia, and the group seems to be close friends by now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=coco-arquette><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Coco Arquette</span></h2><p><a href=#>Young Coco Arquette grew up right in the spotlight</a> too, as the daughter of the Friends star Courteney Cox and actor/director/producer David Arquette. Coco has, however, proved her own talent many times. During quarantine, she and Courteney posted a few videos making music together, with the actress playing the piano and Coco singing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Judd Apatow Has Been Up To Recently</a></span></p><p>Her skills blew everyone away, including Iris, who was beyond impressed by her "angel and best friend." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She commented on the post</a> saying that she was "so talented it hurts."

She's very young, but she's had a long career already. She began dancing when she was just three years old and competed for a decade before becoming a social media hit. She's since obtained multiple brand deals and ad campaigns that have raised her popularity even more. Nowadays, she's very close with Iris, and the two of them share the same group of friends.</p><h2 id=natalia-bryant><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Natalia Bryant</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is no denying that Natalia Bryant's life hasn't been easy these last couple of years.

The two of them go way back, apparently. Iris Apatow was a VIP guest at the SOUR release party, and the two of them constantly post about how much they love and support each other. One of the things Olivia shared that they love doing together is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">binge-watch sitcoms and shows from the early 2000s</a>, and there is one in particular that they really identify with.</p><p>"I think weâre Carrie and Samantha from Sex and the City," the singer said. "We are dramatic, fiercely loyal, and we both love going to brunch."
