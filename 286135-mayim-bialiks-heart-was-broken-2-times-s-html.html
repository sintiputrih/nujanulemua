A year later, she fell in love again, and in 2018, she received the worst holiday present. Find out what it was.</p><p class=dh>American actress, Game-show Host, and Author, Mayim Bialik is famous for her roles in several popular sitcoms. From 1991 to 1995, the Hollywood star played Blossom Ruby Russo in the NBC sitcom "Blossom."</p><p class=dh>However, she gained international recognition when she acted as Amy Farrah Fowler, a neuroscientist and the clever wife of Sheldon Cooper, in the popular CBS sitcom "The Big Bang Theory."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5108586c45a71babbc1149620161d9df.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A selfie featuring Mayim Bialik in a blue tee [left], Mayim Bialik in a scene from "The Big Bang Theory" [right] | Photo: instagram.com/missmayim youtube.com/Movies R Us</p><p class=dh>A memorable scene in the movie was Bialik's character, Amy, tying the knot with Cooper. Amy prepared excitedly for the big day by trying on her wedding dress before walking down the aisle.</p><p class=dh>While she was filled with joy during the episode, in real life, Bialik later explained that it was difficult trying on the wedding dress in the series due to her painful divorce from her ex-husband, Michael Stone. Let's take a look into the marital life of Mayim Bialik and the challenges she faced.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/4abf53d693df50633942cd5186baeafe.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Mayim Bialik poses for a portrait during the 21st Annual Critics' Choice Awards on January 17, 2016. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MAYIM BIALIK AND MICHAEL STONE'S RELATIONSHIP</strong></p><p class=dh>Bialik and Stone were happily married for almost ten years before going their separate ways. They <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://parade.com/1248133/alexandra-hurtado/mayim-bialik-husband/>met </a>as graduate students at the University of California, Los Angeles, during a calculus class. The pair formed a bond, and they became close study partners quickly.</p><p class=dh>Bialik and Stone took their platonic relationship to the next level by going on a date, where they talked about various issues, including religion.</p><p class=dh>Stone was raised a Mormon, and on the other hand, Bialik was a Jew. During an interview, the latter recalled telling her ex-husband that she could only marry a Jew. With his emotional attachment to Bialik, Stone was left with no choice but to convert to Judaism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/6d3e320592d415f0f76442b43c0ba1af.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Mayim Bialik and husband Michael Stone during Opening Night of "Cavalia" - Arrivals at Big Top in Glendale | Photo:Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The duo's relationship went on smoothly. They became intimate and got married in 2003 in a Victorian-themed Jewish ceremony in Pasadena, California.</p><p class=dh>In 2005, Bialik and Stone welcomed their first son, Miles, and three years later, they celebrated the arrival of their second son, Frederick. The actress considers motherhood as one of her greatest achievements. She shares a great bond with her children and has been open about parenting.</p><p class=dh>In 2012, Bialik wrote a book titled "Beyond the Sling: A Real-life Guide to Raising Confident, Loving Children the Attachment Parenting Way." The book gave a detailed explanation of Bialik's parenting methods, including extensive breastfeeding and attachment parenting.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>BIALIK ON ATTACHMENT PARENTING</strong></p><p class=dh>The content of Bialik's book was majorly derived from her personal experiences as a mother. The game-show host breastfed her son Frederick until he was four years old and self-weaned.</p><p class=dh>In addition, the mom of two was co-sleeping with her children, believing that it nurtured connections between her and the kids. Although the mother of two thought of her parenting methods as ideal, she was subjected to a ton of criticism.</p><p class=dh>In a chat with In Touch Magazine, Bialik <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://meaww.com/call-me-kat-big-bang-theory-mayim-bialik-attachment-parenting-breastfeed-son-4>spoke </a>candidly about the backlash she received and how they made her feel. The Hollywood star revealed that people laughed and sneered at her decisions.</p><p class=dh>Bialik noted that several people said mean things to her and admitted that those words made her cry. Although the author was hurt, she was focused on being the best mom to her son. Today, Miles and Frederick are teenagers, and Bialik is proud of how she raised them.</p><p class=dh>Not only did she bring them up in love, but she also taught them to eat healthily: Miles and Frederick are vegetarians. Overall, it appears that Bialik has successfully handled fame and parenthood. Even though her sons do not <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://metro.co.uk/2020/09/04/the-big-bang-theorys-mayim-bialik-reveals-her-sons-dont-know-shes-famous-13224848/%C2%A0>know </a>she is famous, she will always be recognized.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>BIALIK AND STONE'S DIVORCE</strong></p><p class=dh>Bialik is an amazing mother to her boys. However, Miles and Frederick did not get the chance to enjoy a complete home, as they witnessed their parent's divorce at a young age. After nine years of marriage, Bialik and Stone divorced in 2012.</p><p class=dh>The actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-bialik-divorce/big-bang-theory-actress-mayim-bialik-husband-divorcing-idUSBRE8AN01X20121124>made </a>the news public via a Facebook post, noting that it was sad, painful, and incomprehensible for her children. Bialik revealed that their priority was to make the transition of two loving homes as smooth as possible.</p><p class=dh>According to the "Big Bang Theory" star, Miles and Frederick deserved parents who were serious about their health and growth. Following the split, Bialik began writing divorce blog posts as public therapy. It was not an easy experience for the star who mentioned that she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/mayim-bialik-interview-divorce-blog-posts-cried-wrote-20009992>cried </a>whenever she wrote a post.</p><p class=dh>However, Bialik was determined to help other women facing similar issues. Despite the purpose of the posts, the Hollywood star was worried about the pressure to get married again and unsure about how to deal with it. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5667061/Mayim-Bialik-admits-trying-wedding-dresses-Big-Bang-Theory-hard-divorcee.html>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I tried to be married once, I was in that position, andâ¦ I failed."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>BIALIK'S SECOND HEARTBREAK</strong></p><p class=dh>After her divorce, Bialik found herself as a single woman again; she was almost forty. But she found love again not long after. The actress and her man, who she never publicly identified, dated for five years before they broke up.</p><p class=dh>The former couple split during the holiday season in 2018. Bialik was saddened by the situation and aired her thoughts via Instagram. The author <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/mayim-bialik-christmas-depression-breakup-boyfriend-five-years/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I'm newly single and not doing so well to be quite honest."</p><p class=dh>In another post, Bialik <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/mayim-bialik-christmas-depression-breakup-boyfriend-five-years/>stated</a>, "Commercials tell me this is the time of the year to buy the woman you love expensive jewelry. It's also when people get proposed to. And I would be lying if I said it didn't enter my mind that this holiday season might hold a promise of a secure future for me."</p><p class=dh>Sadly, Bialik did not receive any promises. Instead, she was left heartbroken. The star also jokingly offered some relationship advice. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://groknation.com/relating/mayim-bialik-breakup/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"If, however, you are recently single and your heart hurts, here are my tips for surviving this season without being sent to jail for assaulting a woman as her fiance proposes to her in the middle of the mall: Exercise, no sad music, know your limits, etc."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>BIALIK'S PRESENT RELATIONSHIP</strong></p><p class=dh>Currently, the "Jeopardy" host is in a good place. Last February, she said she was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a37621199/mayim-bialik-boyfriend-jonathan-cohen/>dating </a>her podcast co-host, Jonathan Cohen. Cohen is a writer, poet, futurist, father and holds a Master's degree in Fine Arts.</p><p class=dh>Fans of the actress are happy and supportive of <a class="me a" href=#>Bialik</a>'s relationship.
