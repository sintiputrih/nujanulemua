Whilst she is the youngest in the family, <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>'s love life has recently been making headlines. Since she split up from Travis Scott at the beginning of 2023, there have been a lot of rumors surrounding Kylie's current dating habits, with recent supports suggesting that she's dating actor <a href=#>Timothée Chalamet</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, whilst this may seem simple enough on its own, there has been a lot of speculation online (particularly on Reddit) as to what Timothée's relationship status was prior to meeting Kylie and whether he was potentially already dating someone else.</p><h2 id=kylie-and-timoth-eacute-e-have-been-spotted-in-public-together>Kylie And Timothée Have Been Spotted In Public Together</h2><p>Whenever rumors come to fruition about a potential new celebrity romance, anyone who's a fan will constantly be on the lookout for sightings of the potential pair and if they do happen to spot them, they'll also be looking for signs that this could be more than a friendship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thethings-jpgkylie-jenner-and-timothee-chalamet-s-relationship-may-be-kept-a-secret-from-the-public-for-this-reason.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Reddit, there have been many threads about this potential relationship, including one that posted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photos of Kylie at Timothée's house</a> for a BBQ, where it's alleged that some of her family were present (as well as his).</p><p>This was further backed up by the fact that there have been sources saying that Kylie's family approves of the relationship, although it's <a href=#>unlikely that she'll be letting him meet her kids</a> anytime soon.</p><p>It's known that the Kar-Jenners are rather protective about their children and who they meet and given that this relationship is relatively new and potentially just a rebound due to it only being a few months since her breakup from Travis, it's unknown if or when her children will be meeting Timothée.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Travis Scott Reportedly Dating SZA As He Clashes With Kylie Jenner Over Timothée Chalamet Romance</a></span></p><p>It has also been reported that Kylie sleeps over at his house multiple times a week, they work out together, have been to Paris together, and have been on numerous dates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether this is a rebound or not, it seems to be becoming quite serious, despite it being believed that <a href=#>there may not actually be much in the Kylie-Timothée dating rumors</a>.</p><h2 id=fans-thought-timoth-eacute-e-and-taylor-russell-might-have-been-dating>Fans Thought Timothée And Taylor Russell Might Have Been Dating</h2><p>When it comes to rumors about which celebrities are dating, it tends to come out that one celebrity will be dating multiple different people at any one time (although these are often just rumors and not all of them tend to be true).</p><p>One of these rumors was that Timothée and Taylor Russell were dating. This was another potential celebrity relationship that was spoken about quite a lot on Reddit, with it supposedly being confirmed that the pair had been dating until Kylie came into the picture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/timothee-chalamet-taylor-russell.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the run-up to Timothée first being seen with Kylie, there was a lot of speculation that Timothée and Taylor were dating. This first started after they had finished filming for Bones And All when there was a lot of <a href=#>confusion as to whether Timothée and Taylor were dating</a>, or whether they were just very good friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Nearly All Of Timothée Chalemet's Movies Have Sparked Fiery Dating Rumors That Fans Still Aren't Sure Are False</a></span></p><p>The confusion mostly came about due to Deuxmoi, who first said on her podcast that the pair were dating, but then seemed to backtrack a week later and said that she had made a mistake and that the rumors weren't true at all.</p><p>It has also been reported from other sources that the pair had been hooking up a handful of times, but that this was never anything serious. This would make sense, given that the Timothée and Kylie dating rumors surfaced not that long after this, so even if the pair had been dating, it was unlikely to be too serious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-kylie-jenner-steal-timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-from-taylor-russell>Did Kylie Jenner Steal Timothée Chalamet From Taylor Russell?</h2><p>Of course, it's always possible that the dating of two people could overlap slightly and this may have happened with Timothée, Taylor, and Kylie. Especially if the supposed dating between Taylor and Timothée wasn't serious (if anything), this is one possibility.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/timothee-chalamet-taylor-russell.jpg><p>On one Reddit thread, many users were speculating whether this was the case, or whether it was completely made up. Despite what Deuxmoi had said, the majority were of the opinion that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie hadn't stolen Timothée from Taylor</a> and that their supposed relationship was something that had been completely blown out of proportion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, those same people were also mostly of the opinion that Taylor was interested in Timothée, but that it was more of a one-sided thing and that he was never interested in her. Obviously, this is just speculation, and it's not proven whether either of them had feelings for one another and if they did, whether those feelings were reciprocated.</p><p>Within this, it's also believed that Timothée may have wanted his relationship with Kylie to be kept under wraps because he was worried that (assuming that Taylor did have feelings for him), that she would end up getting hurt.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner And Timothée Chalamet's Relationship May Be Kept A Secret From The Public For This Reason</a></span></p><p>Other users believe that the pair may have had a fling of some sort, as hinted at one point by Deuxmoi, but that the feelings were never any stronger than this and that they were primarily friends for the most part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But from the looks of things, Kylie never stole Timothée from Taylor, and it was all just a rumor that got out of hand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60edOipKismJqybq%2FHmqOapZWpeqWt06KloGWSmrOwvsRmorKkmZp6q7HNp5yrZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./wfan-signs-boomer-esiason-gregg-giannotti-to-contract-extensions.html>&#171;&nbsp;WFAN signs Boomer Esiason, Gregg Giannotti to contract extensions</a>
