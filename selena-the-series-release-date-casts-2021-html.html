How Did She Die?&nbsp;</h2><p>Selena&nbsp;Quintanilla was born on April 16, 1971, with Mexican and Native American heritage. At the age of 10, she started singing in her family band,&nbsp;Selena y Los Dinos, collaborating with&nbsp;her sister&nbsp;Suzette Quintanilla and brother&nbsp;A.B.&nbsp;Quintanilla.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Within a decade, she gained massive fanbase in the Latino community and played a key role in promoting Tejano music to the English speakers. She was dubbed as "Mexican Madonna" and often dragged into controversy for&nbsp;her sassy personality, fierceness, individuality, rousing stage-dance choices, and&nbsp;skintight clothing that many dubbed "immodest." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 1994, Quintanilla's album Entre a Mi Mundo won the Best Mexican-American album at the 36th Grammy awards. With the award, she became the first-ever female Tejano artist to win in the category.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>On March 31 of the next year, Quintanilla <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">died of a gunshot</a> in a hotel room. The culprit was none other than the manager of her boutiques, Yolanda Saldivar—who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took her employer's life</a> after she was alleged of embezzling funds that belonged to Quintanilla's fan club that she had founded.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Madison Taylor Baez as Young Selena Quintanilla</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Madison Taylor stars as young Selena Quintanilla in 2020's Selena: The Cast</strong> (Photo: Instagram/Emaze)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Madison Taylor Baez is a nine-year-old singer-actress from Orange County, South California.

Quintanilla had a pear-shaped body and broader face in comparison to Serrato's slim banana-shaped body and slender face.</p><p>Furthermore, the deceased singer was an international music and fashion icon of her time. She was married early and died at the age of 23. On the other hand, Serratos though enjoying a fair share of popularity in a short period of time isn't the biggest and worldwide icon that Selena was. To put it in the context, Serratos, who has a daughter with a long-time-boyfriend, has less drama and controversies in her life as compared to the famous 90's singer.</p><p>Still, there's too much in Serrato's plate to get excited. Similar to Selena, she has hit the home ground with her passion.&nbsp;From the age of 3 to ten years forward, she was active in competitive skating.&nbsp;In between that period, she also managed to sign a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">modeling dea</a>l with the Ford modeling agency.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>In 2004, she graced the screen appearing on Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide produced by Nickelodeon and collaborated with the show in the upcoming seasons. From her first debut in the show to date, she has won the Best Supporting Actress (for Angela Weber in the movie Twilight, 2008)&nbsp;and proven her acting prowess on The Walking Dead as Rosita Espinosa.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to professional acting, Serratos is also not afraid to wear tight-fitting and revealing dresses just like&nbsp;Quintanilla.&nbsp;After all, Serratos was pronounced as Maxim's Hot 100 personality. She is equal in terms of fashion sense, if not more than Quintanilla.</p><p>Of course, Serratos' singing is not at the level of&nbsp; the Quintanilla, but she sure can sing in tune,</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Seidy Lopez as Marcella Samora</h2><p></p><p><strong>Seidy Lopez is playing Selena's mother Marcella Samora </strong>(Photo: IMDb/Glamour Fame)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Mexican-American actress Seidy Lopez has been a part of movies such as Training Day (2001), My Family (1995), Soaked in Bleach (2015), and so on.&nbsp;Also, she also&nbsp;featured in the 1997 biographical movie Selena as a character named Deborah. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Now, she is portraying Selena Quintanilla's mother Marcella Samora in the series.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ricardo Chavira as Abraham Quintanilla Jr.</h2><p></p><p><strong>Ricardo Chavira now (left) vs Abraham Quintanilla Jr in the 90s </strong>(Photo: Instagram/Pinterest) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>American actor Ricardo Chavira is known for Welcome to the Family, Desperate Housewives, and Piranha 3D.
