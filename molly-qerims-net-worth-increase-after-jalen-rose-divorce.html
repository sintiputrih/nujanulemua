Millions of people watched it every day, making it one of ESPN's most-watched programs. In 2015, Qerim became the show's moderator and host.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>WWE To Become Monopolized by ESPN?</a></span></p><p>Her charisma, grace, and ability to keep discussions calm while still allowing for intense arguments make her the ideal choice to moderate the show.</p><p>As of the year 2023, Qerim has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amassed a net worth of $4 million</a>. All of her earnings, including her salary from ESPN, sponsorship deals, and guest appearances, add up to this total.

Despite the absence of details, it is likely that she earns a comfortable living thanks to her now-established career.</p><h2 id=why-did-molly-qerim-and-jalen-rose-get-divorced>Why Did Molly Qerim And Jalen Rose Get Divorced?</h2><p>Jalen Rose and Molly Qerim are two well-known faces you may recognize from ESPN. While they are normally in the headlines for their opinions on sports, the fact that they recently divorced has garnered a lot of attention from the media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/4-2.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the divorce was amicable, the reasons for it are yet unknown. It has been theorized that Molly Qerim's friendship with Stephen A. Smith, a coworker, was the cause of Jalen Rose and Qerim's breakup. The rumor has caused speculations that <a href=#>the NBA players are beefing</a> over Qerim’s attention.</p><p>Jalen Rose sets the record straight in his interview with GQ's Tyler R. Tynes, shutting down rumors that his split with Molly Qerim was due to her alleged relationship with Stephen A. Smith. Though <a href=#>Smith has angered a lot of people</a>, Rose certainly isn’t one of them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>ESPN Analyst And Former NFL Quarterback Ryan Leaf Arrested</a></span></p><p>Rose confidently stated that he knew the rumors weren't true. He chose not to respond to them, as he believed it would only make those who spread them appear less credible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s not true. But, when it happened, it’s two ways for me to handle it as a professional: I work with him, I got love for him, and that's my brother. I got love for her, we were friends before we were married, we just didn’t work as a couple. I just saw her today. We cool! But for me to see the speculation and for people to assume that was why, it bothered me.”</p><p>Why the rumors "bothered" Jalen Rose is reasonable. It's completely understandable to feel uneasy about false information being spread, especially when it comes to such a sensitive topic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2-7.png><p>According to court documents, Rose stated that their marriage had irretrievably broken down after Qerim relocated to Connecticut. According to TMZ, Rose expressed that he and Qerim have decided that staying friends and colleagues is the best way to move forward with their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Qerim cried in June 2021, just two months after Rose filed for divorce, as she talked about his difficulties and the deaths of several members of his family.</p><p>With tears streaming down her face, she lovingly referred to him as her 'husband' while sharing the heartbreaking news of losing five family members this year. As she spoke out about him, Molly referred to it as "a hard couple of years."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3-6.png><p>Rose is taking a stand in his divorce documents by refusing to ask for alimony and making it clear that he doesn't want Qerim to receive it either, according to the outlet. Qerim is not seeking spousal support, and there's no prenup in place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maybe the rumors about his divorce will finally die down now that Rose has cleared the air. The public nature of famous people's social lives frequently provides fertile ground for gossip. Now that the truth about Qerim and Stephen A.
