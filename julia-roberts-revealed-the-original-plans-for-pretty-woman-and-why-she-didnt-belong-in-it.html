For example, most people have no idea how many people work behind the scenes on major movies, how boring working on a film can be, or how much money is spent promoting blockbusters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to the misconceptions that a lot of people have about Hollywood, one of the biggest has to be the idea that film scripts usually closely reflect the final movie that gets made. In reality, movies often undergo massive changes during the pre-production process, while they are filmed, and most notably when they are edited. In fact, some of the most popular movies ever made almost were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">radically different</a>, for one reason or another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Julia-Roberts-Red-Carpet.jpg><p>A lot of the time, movies are forced to change because of budget constraints. With that in mind, you may think that most romantic comedies stay mostly faithful to their original script. As it turns out, that simply isn’t the case as evidenced by the extremely different original plans for Pretty Woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Classic Movies That Almost Had Crazy Alternate Endings</a></span></p><h2 id=a-gigantic-star>A Gigantic Star</h2><p>In the years since Julia Roberts became an acting megastar, her legions of fans have continued to love her so much that they want to know about every <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interesting fact</a> there is about her. Thankfully for them, based on all of the behind-the-scenes stories of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roberts’ on set antics</a>, she seems like a fun person to work with, at least assuming you aren’t Nick Nolte.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Julia-Roberts-Erin-Brokovich.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Commonly referred to as America’s Sweetheart throughout her lengthy career, Julia Roberts starred in some of the most popular films of all-time. For example, most people adore Roberts in movies like Pretty Woman, My Best Friend's Wedding, Stepmom, Notting Hill, and Ocean's Eleven. On top of being lovable, Roberts has proved herself to be a titan of acting in more dramatic films like Erin Brockovich, The Normal Heart, Wonder, and August: Osage County.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which Julia Roberts Movie Are You, Based On Your Zodiac?</a></span></p><h2 id=a-different-woman>A Different Woman</h2><p>In 2019, Julia Roberts and Patricia Arquette took part in an “Actors on Actors” wide-ranging conversation for Variety’s YouTube channel. During the just over 40-minute discussion, it was revealed that many years earlier, Arquette auditioned for Roberts’ legendary Pretty Woman role. On top of talking about auditioning for the film, Arquette brought up the fact that Pretty Woman originally was a “gritty art movie” called $3,000 and that had a “really heavy” ending.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quickly picking up on that conversational thread, Julia Roberts went on to reveal just how dark <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the original ending</a> for Pretty Woman was. According to Roberts, the movie was going to end with her character getting “(thrown) out of the car” with money thrown on top of her. Worse yet, the man who tossed her out of the car would then “sort of (drive) away, leaving her in some dirty alley”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Julia-Roberts-and-Richard-Gere-Pretty-Woman.jpg><p>During the conversation, Roberts didn’t specifically say that Richard Gere’s character Edward Lewis was the one who was going to throw her out of the car. However, based on the movie that was eventually made, it seems very safe to assume that would have been the case if things hadn’t changed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 BTS Facts About Julia Roberts And The Cast Of Pretty Woman</a></span></p><h2 id=back-and-forth>Back And Forth</h2><p>On top of touching on how different Pretty Woman’s original ending was during their “Actors on Actors” discussion, Roberts and Arquette talked about how dark the whole movie was going to be. It was during this stage of the conversation that Roberts said; “I had no business being in a movie like that, really”. Despite Roberts feeling that way, she was chosen to star in the movie when it was still going to be very gritty.</p><p>Continuing, Roberts then revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what happened after</a> she initially was cast as Pretty Woman’s main character. “I get the part, the studio that had it, a small movie company, folded over the weekend, and by Monday I didn’t have a job. And then it went to Disney, and I thought, ‘Went to Disney? Are they going to animate it?’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even after Pretty Woman became a Disney production, things easily could have been very different as Julia Roberts was no longer attached to the project. Fortunately, Roberts got involved in the film that took her career to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another level</a> yet again because of the kindness of the man who helmed Pretty Woman.</p><p>“Then when Garry Marshall came on, I think because he’s a great human being, he met me just because I had once had the job and he felt it would only be fair to at least meet me, since I had this job for three days and lost it. And they changed the whole thing. And it really became more something that is in my wheelhouse than what it originally was.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Movies To Watch On Netflix If You Like Pretty Woman</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihrqSZlnqzu8Geqa2rXaeyt7HApZydZaSdsm670aKeoqaRoXqxuMCnqmaen6d6sb7ErauyZaekuqK6jJqlnWWnncZuv8eeZJ2hlKPBbq7Epaann12eu26102g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./micki-stoltt.html>&#171;&nbsp;Micki Stoltt Wiki, Wife, Age, Height, Parents &amp;amp; Net Worth</a>
