The young couple had gone to the Bahamas with the team for a preseason retreat when the incident left KJ shattered.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kj-martin-clippers.jpg><p>Immediately after catching his partner with his Rockets’ teammate, the power forward called his dad. He informed his dad that his prediction had come true.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, KJ moved from Clippers to 76ers, which saw <a href=# rel=noopener>James Harden</a> team up with <a href=# rel=noopener>Russell Westbrook</a>. Kenyon Sr wasn’t happy with the move, but KJ Martin has outlined many positives, including playing with <a href=# rel=noopener>Joel Embiid</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Tyrese Maxey</a>, and De’Anthony Melton.</p><h2>KJ Martin Girlfriend: Who Is 76ers Forward Dating?</h2><p>The 76ers power forward KJ Martin seems to be currently single and has kept his personal life under wraps. On his Instagram handle, Martin hasn’t shared any posts that could hint he is in a relationship with someone special.</p><p>But even previously, when KJ was in a relationship, he hadn’t shared any romantic posts, so that logic also doesn’t fit the narrative. Recently, his dad and former NBA star Kenyon Martin Sr spilled the beans about the 76ers forward’s past dating life.&nbsp;</p><h3>KJ Martin’s Dad, Keyon Martin, Talks About His Son Getting Cheated On</h3><p>In a recent interview, the former Denver Nuggets player, Kenyon Martin, said a Houston Rocket player slept with his son’s partner.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident happened a couple of years back when KJ was in his second season. The 52nd overall pick of the Houston Rockets, KJ Martin, and his girl had traveled to the Bahamas with his teammate for a little preseason retreat.&nbsp;</p><p>When he returned from an outing, KJ knocked on his door and found another player sleeping with his girlfriend. Kenyon Martin didn’t reveal the Houston Rockets players’ names but told the listeners he had already warned his son about the girl.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kj-martin-cheated.jpg><p>In his interview, Kenyon Sr recalled the moment he told his son, “Listen, do not be surprised if she is f—— one of your teammates.” Unfortunately for KJ, what his dad said happened, and that too when they had traveled to have fun.&nbsp;</p><p>Since that interview, NBA fans have been trying their best to find out who could’ve backstabbed KJ. The post was recently shared on the 76ers <a href=# rel=noopener>Reddit page</a>, with fans guessing several names.&nbsp;</p><p>But many fans have said Kenyon Sr shouldn’t have talked about his son’s love life on a public platform.</p><h2>KJ Martin Traded To 76ers For James Harden</h2><p>During the live segment of Gil’s Arena, Kenyon Martin didn’t only talk about his son’s love life but also his recent move to the 76ers. The former NBA player was emotional talking about it.</p><p>With KJ joining the Clippers this season, it was an opportunity for him to be closer to his family. So, being traded to the 76ers only three games into the season certainly disappointed KJ and his family.</p><p>Kenyon Sr’s voice got heavy as he said that side of business could be difficult for fans to comprehend. The fans only see a player being traded from one team to another. But for a family, it changes the dynamic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kj-martin-76ers.jpg><p>Martin Sr realizes his son can get a better playing chance at the 76ers. The only thing he wishes it wasn’t so early in the season. His son KJ remains optimistic about the trade and focused on the positives from the situation in a press conference.&nbsp;</p><p>KJ said he is familiar with 76ers head coach <a href=# rel=noopener>Nick Nurse’s</a> coaching style. He also emphasized he has been working with the 76ers assistant coach, Rico Rhines since he was 15.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC3yWakmqqknrtus8iro5%2BqmZq7pXnWoaZmoaNihHex0axkn6eirK6zsIydmK2hnpx8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bamboo-manalac-bio-family-career-wife-wealth-measurements.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bamboo Maalac Bio, Family, Career, Wife, Wealth, Net Worth</a>
