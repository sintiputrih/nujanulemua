After coming back from the honeymoon, the couple officially called it quits after they realized they just could not get along. Since leaving the show, Chris put his time and effort into his real estate business and even met a new woman. He is now “taken” and enjoying the relationship.</p><h2 id=alyssa-ellman-regrets-how-she-handled-things><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Alyssa Ellman Regrets How She Handled Things</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When talking about her divorce with Chris Collette, Alyssa Ellman admitted that she did not handle things well in her marriage. From bad-mouthing her husband the entire time she was on the show to refusing to talk with the experts, she set herself up for failure and ended up panicking when faced with the hard truth. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alyssa did share that she regretted</a> the way she acted with Chris and learned a lot about herself in this process.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Meka And Michael From 'Married At First Sight' Still Together?</a></span></p><h2 id=michael-morency-called-for-a-divorce-after-decision-day><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Michael Morency Called For A Divorce After Decision Day</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael Morency was paired with Jasmina Outar in this season of the show. When the two made it to decision day, they decided that despite their miscommunications and arguments, they would work through their differences and fight for their marriage. Unfortunately, that thought process only lasted a few weeks after decision day, as the couple ended up divorcing only two and a half weeks later. The decision was brought up by Michael, but Jasmina agreed it was the best choice.</p><h2 id=jasmina-outar-admits-she-never-felt-romantic-with-michael><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jasmina Outar Admits She Never Felt Romantic With Michael</span></h2><p>Jasmina Outar, the second half of Michael Morency during the show, faced some serious difficulties in the marriage. Claiming that Mike was aggressive in the way he talked to her caused her to constantly put her defenses up and did not allow them to talk through their issues. When he brought up divorce, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she admitted that she never truly felt romantic</a> feelings towards him but instead saw him as a friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsey-georgoulis-is-fierce-and-no-longer-married><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lindsey Georgoulis Is Fierce And No Longer Married</span></h2><p>Lindsey Georgoulis was without a doubt the firecracker of the season. She and her partner Mark Maher made the decision to move in together post-decision day. Although she went into decision day feeling supported and optimistic, things quickly turned sour as rumors spread about both her and Mark, and the threats they made against each other during the two months they were together post-show. Because of the blowout fights, she is now a divorcee.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Clara Berghaus And Ryan Oubre Aren't Together Still</a></span></p><h2 id=mark-maher-is-devoting-his-newfound-free-time-to-his-businesses><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Mark Maher Is Devoting His Newfound Free Time To His Businesses</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mark Maher was apparently not the same man he was in front of the cameras as he was when they were not around. Whether it was intentional or in response to bullying from his wife, he breathed a sigh of relief when the divorce was decided upon. Right now Mark is staying single and devoting this newfound free time to getting his clothing brand MTS 1983 prepped for release and his watch brand Switch Ups ramped up.</p><h2 id=olajuwon-dickerson-amp-katina-goode-have-overcome-the-odds-remaining-married><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Olajuwon Dickerson & Katina Goode Have Overcome The Odds, Remaining Married</span></h2><p>Olajuwon Dickerson and Katina Goode had to figure out how to build healthy communication together, as she found his tone to be harsher and more negative than he was intending it to be. The couple worked to better understand each other, and while social media was unashamed in telling Katina to dump her husband, her gut told her not to give up on him, and they are both so happy that she didn’t!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=noi-phommasak-amp-steve-moy-are-planning-to-have-kids-soon><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Noi Phommasak & Steve Moy Are Planning To Have Kids Soon</span></h2><p>Noi Phommasak and Steve Moy worked hard to become more comfortable with their feelings on his joblessness and their tension about money issues. Noi has lightened up, and the couple has been able to reach compromises when necessary. They are so happy to have stayed married, and sources say they are even talking about growing their family in the next year or two.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Happened To The 'Married At First Sight' Season 10 Couples?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsDHnmSmmaKntqawjJqrZp6Zp8C1edKinqGsXaiyor%2FOp2RqbF2YvLa8y56qZqWZmLWisctmpKiqlaOwunnJmqqmoZ6WerDB05qpaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./where-is-paul-cicala-going-after-leaving-kvia.html>&#171;&nbsp;Where Is Paul Cicala Going After Leaving KVIA?
