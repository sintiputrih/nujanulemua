This movie remains a fan favorite not just for his impressive physique but also for his fighting skills. Zack Snyder directed it, and according to The Hollywood Reporter, the film set a box office record, earning almost half a billion worldwide.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Gerard Butler Says Katherine Heigl Was 'So Good' In That Scene In The Ugly Truth</a></span></p><p>"If the script was good, I would do it," Butler told People (via Digital Spy) of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">possibly taking on the role of Leonidas again</a>. "I've got to feel that there's a real reason to go there, to do a second one, because I loved the first. I hope that they write a great script, and I hope that I love it." And the moment we have all been waiting for: He admitted this was his favorite film to work on, saying, "That was my favorite role, and it would be great to go back there and have some fun with it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gerard-butler-2.jpg><p>But what made this such a standout performance for Butler? For starters, it could have something to do with how his body looked. "That was the best shape I have ever been in in my life," he told The Hollywood Reporter of his role.</p><p>"<a href=#>In some ways I was ruining my body, but I was looking amazing doing it</a>." But he was not always confident that the film would be a success. He recalled: "There were times you would walk around in your red cape and little leather underpants, and someone would point at nothing and say, 'Look! A burning village!' And I remember going, 'Oh my God. This movie's going to suck.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When I first saw the final product, I was with 13 of my representatives and friends, and our jaws were dropping," Butler said. "It was like, 'Look at what Zack did!' I can't speak highly enough about him. As a director, as a creative, as a kind, excited, passionate guy."</p><p>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was one of his most standout and enjoyable roles, it was not without its challenges</a>. And we are not just talking about the intense fight scenes and grueling workouts. No, we are referring to the costumes. When asked about costume difficulties in a 2007 interview with Collider, Butler admitted some discomfort was definitely involved.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Despite Playing A 'Regular Person' In Plane, Gerard Butler Pushed For Action Sequences</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"A lot of chafing in the groin area. The weird thing is, the cape, I don't want to sound like a pu*** because I trained really hard, but the cape, everything," he said. "It's like if you were to, say, hold up that tape recorder, that's fine. But if you're to say hold that up for 16 hours, it gets pretty hard. And the cape is actually very heavy. When you first put it on, you don't think about it, but you naturally have to tense your shoulders to wear it. By the end of the day, you'd be just trying to lift it up just to get some relief for your neck.

"I like the idea of being forced into — not forced into nature — but to have that as my everyday experience, to be in nature." He also spoke about his native Scotland and how beautiful the scenery was there. Adding, "I think it's one of the most beautiful places in the world.
