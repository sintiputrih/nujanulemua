As with any nonprofit organization, the salaries of its executives are subject to scrutiny and criticism by the public. In this article, we will explore the salary of the CEO of Goodwill and answer some frequently asked questions related to the topic.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Salary_of_the_CEO_of_Goodwill-2>What is the Salary of the CEO of Goodwill?</span></h2><p>According to the latest available tax filings, the CEO of Goodwill Industries International Inc., Steven C. Preston, received a salary of $729,000 in 2019. This figure includes base salary, bonus, and other compensation. In comparison, the average salary for CEOs of nonprofit organizations in the United States is around $190,000 per year.</p><h2><span id=How_Does_Goodwill_Determine_the_CEO8217s_Salary>How Does Goodwill Determine the CEO’s Salary?</span></h2><p>Goodwill’s board of directors establishes the CEO’s compensation based on a number of factors, including job performance, market trends, and the organization’s financial performance. The board utilizes a third-party compensation consultant to ensure that the CEO’s salary is in line with industry standards and reflects the level of responsibility and expertise required of the position.</p><h2><span id=Is_the_CEO8217s_Salary_Too_High>Is the CEO’s Salary Too High?</span></h2><p>The issue of executive compensation in nonprofit organizations is a hotly debated topic. Some people argue that high salaries deter potential donors from giving to charitable causes, while others argue that these salaries are necessary to attract and retain top talent in the industry.

The organization is generally well-regarded for its mission of helping individuals with barriers to employment and its thrift stores, which provide affordable goods to shoppers.

Some critics argue that the organization’s executive compensation practices are excessive and that the salaries of top executives should be re-evaluated. Others argue that paying some workers with disabilities below minimum wage is exploitative and perpetuates inequalities. Still, others criticize Goodwill’s environmental impact and the waste generated by its thrift stores.</p><h2><span id=Does_Goodwill_Offer_Volunteer_Opportunities>Does Goodwill Offer Volunteer Opportunities?</span></h2><p>Yes, Goodwill offers volunteer opportunities for individuals who want to contribute to the organization’s mission.
