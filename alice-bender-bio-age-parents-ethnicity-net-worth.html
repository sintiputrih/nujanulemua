But, who is she? Why is she more popular than other mothers? Here are a few pieces of information you need to learn more about her.</p><p>This article covers her age, parents, ethnicity, and her net worth.</p><h3><strong>Meet Alice Bender, Fern’s Mom & TikTok Star</strong></h3><p>Alice Bender is a TikTok and YouTube star who is known for sharing her life with her son Fern. Fern is her second-born child who was born in August 2020 as her she lost her first child Aurelia while 29 weeks pregnant in 2019. She had announced her second pregnancy in February of that same year.</p><p>Alice reportedly refused prenatal care because she believed that ultrasounds have radiation. Instead of going to the hospital, she had Fern (second-child) in her bathroom in her apartment in Phoenix, Arizona. She reportedly fished out the placenta from her uterus two hours later. Online records suggested that she believed that all women should be willing to die alone in childbirth rather than go to the hospital or have C-sections.</p><p>Similarly, Alice also found herself in several other controversies when she decided to dress Fern in gender-neutral dresses. Other times, she made him wear her <span class=quote>dead daughter’s dresses.</span></p><p>Many people thought that mothers like Alice shouldn’t be on TikTok because its content has a large audience. The problem was people asked for her advice without her advice derived from her trauma of losing her daughter. Regarding her newborn, she announced the news on Instagram and published a number of images of the natural birth that occurred in her home without any medical assistance.</p><p>“Only a few hours old and you’ve already taught us so much,” the photographs’ captions read. Alice can be seen naked in her bathtub in the pictures (although she has censored all nudity). The remaining slides show her nursing her infant and cuddling her newborn as she is in the bathtub.</p><p>She had previously opened up about not going to welcome her child into this world in hospital. “I am a huge advocate for going all out to make sure you have whatever kind of birth you want to have,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a> on TikTok, “If I had any birth preferences I would definitely make sure they happen, but I don’t. I would be happy giving birth anywhere, baby will come where it comes.”</p><p>“There’s an equal amount of pros and cons to both so I don’t have a preference,” Alice said in response to a follower’s question on whether she would prefer to give birth at home or while traveling.</p><h3><strong>Alice Bender Husband</strong></h3><p>Alice Bender is married to her husband Caleb Bender.

One of its employees and a friend of Caleb launched a <a href=#>GoFundMe</a> 2019 after losing their daughter with a goal of $10,000 of which $4,472 was collected.</p><p>The bio read: “One of our Hub family members is going thru some tragic and trying times right now. Caleb and his wife, Allison, lost their baby in an accident. Allison is ok, but after an emergency C-section, the baby didn’t make it. Due to these events, work will not be easy (if at all possible) for the couple.”</p><p>The post read further, “We are always talking about how the Hub is a family… #hubnation! Right? So I thought we’d put our words into action and help raise some money to help them pay some bills and put food on the table while they recover physically and mentally from the loss and hardships”.</p><p>Caleb is on <a href=#>Facebook</a> but he doesn’t seem to be active.</p><h3><strong>Alice Bender Car Accident</strong></h3><p>Alice Bender had a terrible car accident in February 2019 after he turned left in front of her which caused the accident.

However, Alice held the hospital and the workers for the death of her daughter.</p><p>Alice made a TikTok video where she shared that she didn’t want to undergo a C-section operation. She thinks that her daughter died due to medical intervention meanwhile her son is alive because there was no medical intervention. Moreover, she added that Alice only got her daughter’s medical records 2 years later and had to get a lawyer to request them from which she learned that her daughter was given a vitamin K injection.</p><p>As for the man she had an accident with, according to Alice, he had an extensive driving record. He admitted what happened at the scene of the accident. Alice shared that the man had repeat violations going back to when he started driving. However, the man changed his statement after the accident.</p><p>But, Alice believes though it was a minor accident that he caused, he wasn’t responsible for her daughter’s death.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Alice Bender Parents?</strong></h3><p>Alice Bender is private about her family life. She had shared a few trivia with her followers. Like, growing up her parents fed her meat which she perceived as being abusive. Later, she cut ties with her parents allegedly around 2018-2019. So, who are they, and where they live is a complete mystery.</p><p>However, a <a href=#>TikToker</a> shared a snapshot of the Facebook status of Caleb’s mom which read: “Our granddaughter was due in early May.
