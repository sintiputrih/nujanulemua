We all miss him so much.”</p><p>Norah, who has two daughters, said: “Whoever put Johnny in that canal did it to make it look like a suicide. My son would never have left me alone.

His mum waited two days before contacting police and said from that moment on she felt as if her life has been destroyed.</p><p>Stephanie said: “I knew as only a mother would that something terrible had happened to Rhys.</p><p>"I put it on Facebook asking if anyone had seen him. I heard he was seen with an older woman and we told the police this but they did nothing so me and my sister went to her house and she denied even knowing Rhys.</p><p>“It took the police two weeks to search where his body was found and, even even months later, I’m still not sure of the exact location but he was found half-naked, with his clothes about 20 yards away.</p><p>“His baseball cap was discovered in a common stair and had been washed. The shorts he was wearing that day have never been found.</p><p>“They didn’t have any forensics out they just put him in a van and took him away. They said they wouldn’t get any forensics due to the length of time. It took them seven weeks to formally identify him.”</p><p>Stephanie said her own investigations uncovered CCTV of the teenager with a woman but she revealed that police took days to check cameras at her urging.</p><p>She said: “During those seven weeks, I still kept praying it wasn’t him but I knew deep down. I knew my boy was gone. I have prayed for justice, for answers.</p><p>"This has broken my family. It has consumed my life. I promised Rhys when he was lying in his coffin I would get answers for him and I would get justice. It’s all I can do for my son. We’re all shattered.”</p><h3 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border publication-font brand-bg">Top news stories today</h3><p>“Rhys was a cheeky but loveable teenager with his whole life ahead.</p><p>"His disappearance and death should have been taken more seriously. I feel let down by the police. Nobody from Police Scotland has been helping me. I’ve been forced to seek the answers myself.</p><p>“It’s soul destroying. I can’t let this happen to anyone else. My boy, our boys, deserve more. I beg anyone who may have information to speak to the police or call in anonymously.</p><p>“Someone must know what happened to my son. His brothers and sisters miss him – we all do.”</p><p>Norah said she is clinging to the hope an appeal by police for witnesses will unlock vital information in the hunt for her Johnny’s attackers.</p><p>She added: “It’s taken all this time for police to put out an appeal. When Johnny went missing and his body was found, my ex-husband made a video retracing his steps.</p><p>“They had Johnny on CCTV walking until he got to the underpass at Spiers Wharf. Johnny had learning difficulties and no sense of danger. If someone spoke to him, he’d chat back not realising if he was in danger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article21366832.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_VSP_SDR_240120grievingmums_28JPG.jpg><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p>“It breaks my heart to think my boy would be alive today if he’d been paid his wages when he should have been. He wouldn’t have gone into town, he’d have stayed local and met up with his friends.</p><p>“The police don’t know how he ended up in the water but whoever attacked him did it to make it look like suicide. We still don’t know how Johnny died. He’d been in the water too long. Evidence was lost.</p><p>“The police weren’t helping which is why we put out videos and put up information and appeals on social media.</p><p>“Johnny was a family man. We were very close. His twin sister, Norah, and his big sister Michelle miss him so much – his dad as well. None of us can have peace until we know what happened to him.</p><p>“Johnny had never been in any trouble. He just liked to go to his work, come home, see his friends and enjoy his life. He didn’t deserve to die like that but he does deserve justice. Rhys and Johnny both do.”</p><p>A Police Scotland spokesperson said: "A report on the circumstances surrounding Rhys Bonner's death has been submitted to the Procurator Fiscal and we are awaiting guidance. We keep in regular contact with the family and continue to keep them updated.</p><p>"We have issued a number of appeals for information in recent weeks with regards to John Connelly's death. We keep in regular contact with his family and will continue to update them with any new information.
