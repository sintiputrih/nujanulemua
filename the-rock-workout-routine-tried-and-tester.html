I increased my weights a little this time, whilst wincing at the thought of how my pins would feel tomorrow morning.</p><h3>Day 5</h3><p id=e5TOsdWde69D data-wc=42>Glutes. On. Fire. However, it's a good feeling when your butt feels peachy. Today I opted for arms and abs, with the whole run and weight workout being wrapped up in just under two hours. That's long enough for me I reckon.</p><p id=egrX3vUZ_dBC data-wc=23>The hanging leg raises killed me off slightly, as by then, my arms were in tatters, so gripping onto a pole was excruciating.</p><h3>Day 6</h3><p id=e92qYDbsT9rj data-wc=27>Hey ho hey ho, it's back to the gym we go. Today I ran for 45 minutes then took on the chest workout that I'd previously skipped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/36bcb31adddc-in-gym-z.jpg><p id=endIfdHhcGX5r data-wc=14><strong>To train like The Rock, you need to be in the gym. A lot.</strong></p><p id=ecw7RqUiCd42L data-wc=51>Needless to say, my chest isn't my strongest element so I did every move with the lightest of weights. I still felt the resistance, but I really, really wanted to swerve any aches the next day. If you've ever felt aching muscles after doing chest-based exercises, you'll know what I mean.</p><h3>Day 7</h3><p id=eep0YSyCzbADO data-wc=70>Just like Dwayne, I decided to rest today. He usually has an epic cheat meal on his rest day…I actually decided to just go out for three big meals that were all relatively 'healthy' just monstrously large. As for his plate of cookies, I wasn't prepared to follow suit as I'd quite like to not end this week feeling like a stuffed whale. Although believe me, I was very tempted.</p><h2>What did I learn from training like Dwayne Johnson for one week?</h2><h3>Muscles need FOOD</h3><p id=e1pvaP8Vhhsu- data-wc=40>It's no wonder Dwayne Johnson eats a shed load of meals each day. His five to seven meals a day are a far cry from my three-meals-a-day routine (with snacks, obviously), however, all this muscle training left me very hungry.</p><p id=e7fKn3dQL8dUy data-wc=24>I'm well aware that food is fuel, but I didn't really understand just how much fuel might be needed for this amount of weightlifting.</p><p id=edJXH3ZCotHPJ data-wc=41>I can also see why Dwayne focuses so heavily on protein. After all, protein helps muscles repair and grow; it also helps to keep us fuller for longer, so can help curb those cravings that kick in every day, around 3pm.</p><p id=egpkAeLwxkTHx data-wc=1><strong>MORE:<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Eva Longoria looks fitter than ever in flawless new bikini photo – these are her health secrets</a></strong></p><h3>Splits are great</h3><p id=e91g_bq-wycG2 data-wc=42>I tend to work different muscle groups on different days generally, but Dwayne's plan really did break the muscles down. I have never trained my back and arms on separate days; instead, focusing on the two during one upper body training session.</p><p id=eiFPp1X8GohCG data-wc=60>So, here I was, whacking out endless reps and really honing in on certain areas of the body (and oh boy was I feeling it the next day), but because each day was different, the body part that was hurting, was able to rest and recuperate. It meant I never overworked any muscles and could basically just keep going. Hoorah!</p><p id=eYm0an44qJ8F_ data-wc=1><strong>READ:<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;I tried Adele's extreme three-workouts-a-day regime – and the results might surprise you</a></strong></p><h3>Rest days are key</h3><p id=e3Sc7XpOPHEix data-wc=25>It's hard to get across just how important rest days are. But they really, really are the time when your body actually recovers and repairs.</p><p id=eLSZpN3DFb63a data-wc=63>I've had clients who really despise rest days, however it's vital you take at least a day a week to step away from the gym. I found during this week that a routine focused heavily on weightlifting really did make me desperate for the rest day and I went back to my normal routine after a week of Dwayne Johnson workouts, far stronger.</p><p id=et3oKToE0PSWr data-wc=10>People, embrace the rest day and enjoy the chill time!</p><p id=eoSCFNwTkP3Rc data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The secret health hack loved by sporting legends</a></strong></p><h3>I will totally continue to train like this</h3><p id=ehg3cemvkaMk7 data-wc=73>Hand on heart, I loved this week. Muscle pain aside (my legs and arms are still throbbing), the workout routine was totally up my street. I will absolutely continue to split my weight-lifting a little more rigidly and I will definitely be incorporating more upper body work into my week. I tend to shy away from it, but this week, I had a real balance between lower and upper. Dwayne, you're an inspiration!</p><p id=egIenAeaZjor7 data-wc=27>Warning: Do not try this at home!
