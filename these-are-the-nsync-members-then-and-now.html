Luckily, we don’t have to speak of *NSYNC in the past tense anymore, because due to a recent VMA appearance and an upcoming track on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Trolls 3</strong></a>&nbsp;soundtrack, everyone is dreaming of new music and memories with our favorite boyband, and it looks like these might be dreams that soon come true.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>So, just who are the members of *NSYNC, what have they been up to, and are we driving ourselves crazy thinking of a new album or tour?

Timberlake is one of the most recognizable talents from the late ’90s and early 2000s, and we’ve been a fan of him for a significant chunk of our own lives.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>Some of Timberlake‘s biggest movie roles to date include The Social Network, Bad Teacher, Friends with Benefits, and In Time. Timberlake even voiced Branch in family musical Trolls in 2016. One of Timberlake’s biggest solo albums was released in 2002, filled with songs like “Cry Me a River,” and “Rock Your Body.”</p><p data-characters=643 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>In 2006, Timberlake released another album with a huge number of songs to listen to from “Lovestoned” to “What Goes Around Comes Around.” His most recent album dropped in 2018 and fits into the pop, R&B, electronic, funk, and soul genres. Alongside his extensive professional career, Timberlake is currently married to his wife, Jessica Biel, who is known separately for being a famous Hollywood actress. The duo have been married since 2012, and share two children together. Timberlake has over 63 million followers on Instagram, and has sold over 88 million records worldwide throughout his journey in the music industry.</p><h2 id=h-joey-fatone data-injectable=false>Joey Fatone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/a47cca3ab02f45650cffb42386284a95.jpeg><p data-characters=599 data-current-count=899 data-injectable=true>Joey Fatone was the baritone of *NSYNC, and he definitely added a splash of fun to the boy band with his flamboyance and flair. Fast forward to 2007, and Fatone participated in the ABC reality show Dancing with the Stars. Fatone even came in second place — which is pretty impressive, if you ask us. It seems very likely that Fatone was able to lean on his dancing skills from his time in *NSYNC many years down the line. In his personal life, Fatone has been married to his wife Kelly Baldwin since 2004, and they currently have two kids together. On Instagram, Fatone has over 362,000 followers.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>Fatone also had the important role of playing himself in an episode of How I Met Your Father alongside another friend and band member, and if you didn’t see the episode, we’ll fill you in shortly.</p><h2 id=h-lance-bass data-injectable=false>Lance Bass</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/e2f016fce9df1a727842a462102ef410.jpeg><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>Moving on from *NSYNC to succeeding as a talented TV producer, actor, and dancer beyond the band is exactly what Lance Bass has done. Bass has been married to his husband Michael Turchin since 2014, and they seem to be really happy together. He came out in 2006 as the cover story for People Magazine and won the Human Rights Campaign Visibility award that same year. Bass chose to write an autobiography called Out of Sync in 2007 describing all his experiences. Anyone up-to-date on Netflix reality TV shows will recognizes Bass from a few episodes of The Circle.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Bass also had a stint on&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars, where he came in third place. He was also in episodes of&nbsp;7th Heaven, Gravity Falls, and was a panelist in&nbsp;Unicorn Hunters. Fans also know that Bass also starred in an episode of&nbsp;How I Met Your Father&nbsp;with Fatone, and the pair had a brilliant time playing themselves on the series.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-jc-chasez data-injectable=false>JC Chasez</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-03-at-8.31.31-PM.png><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>JC Chasez is one of the other tenors from *NSYNC who shared the singing position with Timberlake.

These days, Chasez is also very adamant when it comes to convincing his fans to stay in the loop with politics and current events.

On Instagram, Kirkpatrick has over 156,000 followers and one of his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most recent images</a> is a picture of Bass’s floating face on the buttocks of a pair of jeans.
