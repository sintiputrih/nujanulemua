The man was later arrested after he turned up at the home of another QVC presenter in Washington Township. Young was charged with 3 years of stalking female QVC hosts.</p><p>The offender confessed that he had hoped that Pat would help him to meet her co-worker Lisa Robertson. Pat says that the highlight of her career with QVC has been working with her co-hosts, in particular designer and presenter Susan Graver, and the behind the scenes team. Prior to hosting, she was a model-actress for the ERA fashion, Zoli modeling, and Model Management. At the age of 18, James joined the company in July 1978 and worked there till September 1986.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pat-james-dementri-too-close-for-comfort></span><span>Pat James-Dementri Too Close For Comfort</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A Phoenix man convicted three years ago of stalking female hosts of the QVC home shopping channel was arrested after he showed up at the Washington Township home of another of the channelâs personalities. Phillip Young, 52, is charged with harassment and criminal attempted trespass and was held without bail Friday. He was also ordered by the court to undergo a psychological evaluation within 30 days.</p><p>Police arrested Young on Monday after QVC personality Pat James-DeMentri found him on the front porch of her Mercer County home, according to the county prosecutorâs office. Young flew into Newark, rented a car and then drove to her home, prosecutors said.</p><p>He rang the doorbell, and when he identified himself through the intercom, DeMentri immediately dialed 911. After his arrest, authorities found two boxes containing engagement and wedding rings strapped to Youngâs chest. Prosecutors said prior to going to her house, Young had sent DeMentri two telegrams saying he would visit.</p><p>He added that if she signed for the messages, he would assume it was an invitation to him. DeMentri reportedly hosts the morning programs on the 24-hour home shopping channel. She is a professional model and commercial actress and also has been an on-air personality for a TV station in Wilmington, Del.</p><p>The host lives in Washington Township with her husband, CBS newscaster Vince Dementri, and their daughter, Nicole Anna. Young told police he hoped DeMentri would help him meet Lisa Robertson, a QVC host to whom he had sent letters, gifts, and a honeymoon brochure. Robertson has been with QVC since March 1995 and hosts programs dedicated to a variety of interests from music to âStar Trekâ and Star Wars, according to the company website.</p><p>In addition to being a show host, Robertson is also a former Miss Tennessee and competed in the Miss America Pageant. Youngâs obsession seems to have begun in 1997 with letters to yet another QVC host, Kathy Levine. Any person with access to the Internet can send all the QVC hosts letters on their website. It is not clear whether Young sent his letters through e-mail or the postal service.</p><p>In 1998, Young was convicted in Arizona of stalking. He was sentenced to three yearsâ probation and ordered to not have contact with employees of the shopping channel. A QVC spokeswoman declined to comment, saying Youngâs case was still under investigation. She only said that celebrities sometimes face these problems by the nature of their jobs, which is in the spotlight and seemingly more susceptible.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-pat-james-dementri></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Pat James-Dementri</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-pat-james-dementri></span><span>Who is Pat James-Dementri?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pat James-Dementri is a famous journalist working in the field for over three decades.
