The conversation lasted for almost two hours, but here is some of what was discussed:</p><p><strong>JG: What was your childhood like?</strong></p><p>IA: My mom had 7 kids, and my dad was in the Air Force. We lived in Hawaii for about 5-6 years when I was 7. And then of course we moved so I wouldn’t say I grew up in Hawaii, but it has always been home to my soul. We also lived in California, Montana, and Oregon.</p><h2>“[Hawaii] has always been home to my soul.”</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-56049 alt="Charlene Peters Hawaii" width=800 height=530 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/charlene-peters-hawaii.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-56049 class=wp-caption-text>Charlene Peters as a young girl in Hawaii. Source: Charlene Peters’ Personal Archive</p><p><strong>JG: Are you close with your family?</strong><br>IA: It’s not that we’re not close, I just think some of us are closer than others. As in any family we grew apart–especially in the 60s and 70s when I left home. The recent death of my sister Roberta has brought us all back together again.</p><p><strong>JG: When did you first leave home?</strong></p><p>IA: About a year after high school. We were living in Florida because my dad was stationed at Cape Canaveral, and I went to DC and that started my adventure. I was working for my senator at the time.</p><p>Then I ended up being a White House Social Aid under Johnson, and it was a very social scene. A lot of parties. I was given the titles of Miss U.S. Savings Bonds and Cherry Blossom Princess.</p><h2>“I went to DC and that started my adventure.”</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-56052 alt="Charlene Peters Ball Gown" width=800 height=553 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/charlene-peters-ball-gown.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-56052 class=wp-caption-text>Charlene Peters during a gala in DC. Source: Charlene Peters’ Personal Archive</p><p><strong>JG: After DC, what brought you to New York?</strong></p><p>IA: I very quickly realized that cocktail parties with senators just was not what I was looking for, so I moved to New York. If I’d stayed in [DC] I would’ve been married to a highfalutin politician and been an alcoholic. Who the hell knows.</p><p>I was working with an Airline called Braniff at the time. It was a very mod airline. All the planes were different colors. They wore Pucci uniforms. So within New York I ended up in another social circle. A little bit with Andy Warhol and Salvador Dali, but there was just so much drug use. Hard drugs–speed, heroine, cocaine. I think I’ve been very guided in life, because I found myself dabbling in a lot of things, but never getting totally hooked on them.</p><h2>“I very quickly realized that cocktail parties with senators just was not what I was looking for.”</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-55881 alt="Braniff International Emilio Pucci" width=800 height=457 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/braniff-international-emilio-pucci.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-55881 class=wp-caption-text>Braniff International Stewardesses dressed in their Pucci uniforms. Source: The Red List</p><p><strong>JG: When did you move from New York to LA?</strong></p><p>IA: Probably the mid 60s.</p><p><strong>JG: What inspired you to leave New York for LA?</strong></p><p>IA: New York had a very bohemian feeling, which leads to a darkness. I saw LA as something light and bright and fun and good and happy. Spiritual was the word. I flew out a few times and really loved it, so I moved to LA and that was that.</p><p>I totally dropped out and became a flower child–a hippie. But even within that I was in a social circle. I dated a young Rob Reiner and Richard Dreyfuss. It seemed like I had no problem sliding into good social circles.</p><p><strong>JG: When did you first meet Jim Baker [the man who would later become Father Yod, the leader of the Source Family]?</strong><br>IA: A friend of mine–Bobbie Shaw who was an actress at the time–introduced me to Jim Baker, who was a Hollywood legend. He had the Aware Inn and the Old World they were both very famous restaurants on Sunset. We used to go to the Old World. I connected more to his wife at the time–Dora–and we became friends. When I look back on meeting with Jim Baker I always say that just wasn’t our time, but it was interesting that I got to know that part of his life before I ended up joining The Source Family.</p><h2>“That was the gift that whole hippie flower-child movement brought–the gift of relating soul to soul. It was all very much in the now.”</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-55884 alt="Source Family Santa Monica" width=800 height=417 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/source-family-santa-monica.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-55884 class=wp-caption-text>Photo Courtesy Of The Isis Aquarian Archives</p><p><strong>JG: What was your first impression of him?</strong><br>IA: Jim was beautiful. He was extremely handsome, chiseled and 6’3”–big–and he worked out. He was very charming. He had a great personality. Everybody just loved him. He had such a great sense of humor.</p><p><strong>JG: Would you talk about your time with the photographer Ron Raffaelli?</strong><br>IA: Ron came after I was already [in LA] a few years. I’d lost track of Jim and Dora [Baker] and I ended up meeting Ron. He was one of the most famous photographers of the time. He photographed everybody. He was doing a video for Jimi Hendrix and he put out a casting call for some people to come be part of the video.</p><p>A friend of mine at the time said I should go down and I did. I actually went home with Ron that night and just never left. We were together for about three years. I was running the studio with him. I really didn’t feel a lack of anything–I was having a very good life. Ron and I were going to get married.</p><h2>“The thing is I always thought Ron was going to go with me… What a shock to find out that he absolutely was not going to do that and thought I was stark raving mad.”</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-56050 alt="Charlene Peters Ron Rafaelli" width=800 height=530 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/charlene-peters-ron-rafaelli.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-56050 class=wp-caption-text>Photograph of Charlene Peters by Ron Rafaelli. Source: Charlene Peters’ Personal Archive</p><p><strong>JG: How did you become a part of The Source Family?</strong><br>IA: I was looking for a model for a poster that [Ron] was doing–Jesus Christ Superstar. I remembered that Jim had opened up a new [restaurant] called The Source down on Sunset, and I was told that it was people with long hair running around in robes looking like Jesus.</p><p>So I went down one day to see Jim and he walked out. He was no longer Jim Baker. He looked like Moses is all I can say. And that was that. It was like my destiny set in, and I don’t know how to explain it, but I never looked back. I walked out on everything.</p><h2>“He was no longer Jim Baker. He looked like Moses is all I can say.”</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-55883 alt="Father Yod Source Family" width=800 height=450 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/father-yod-source-family.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-55883 class=wp-caption-text>Photo Courtesy Of The Isis Aquarian Archives</p><p><strong>JG: When was this?</strong></p><p>IA: This was early 1972 because my first night in The Family was the first birth of The Family–Solomon’s birth. I brought equipment from the studio and photographed it and that’s when I started archiving.</p><p><strong>JG: Why did you begin documenting The Source Family through photography?</strong><br>IA: I just knew that’s what needed to be done. I would look around and see all these incredible, beautiful people and I would see all this amazing stuff happening and then Father’s morning meditation classes had this incredible wisdom and the bands were playing this incredible music and I just remember not being able to stand it that it wasn’t being captured.</p><p>I just knew that it had to be preserved. Father called me up to the temple shortly after I came in and he told me “I’m making you the Family Historian and Archive Keeper. What you will do one day will save this legacy.” I was pretty stalwart in doing it. I never dropped the ball. After a while there were a few others who started taking photos too, so I was no longer the only photographer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyqv8isZJqppZa%2Fqq3N</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kylie-jenners-own-calendar-got-her-birthday-wrong-w458987.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kylie Jenners Own Calendar Got Her Birthday Wrong</a>
