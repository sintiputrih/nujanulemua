The former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star recently opened up to <strong>Us Weekly</strong> reporter <strong>Brody Brown </strong>in an exclusive interview about everything from finding love again to the complicated seating arrangement for her former RHOBH castmates. The Bravo alum also revealed what her 8-year-old daughter<strong> Kennedy </strong>understands about her late husband’s suicide and her new life after reality TV.</p><p>The 42-year-old wore a stunning strapless form-fitting <strong>Chagoury Couture</strong> gown when she said “I Do” to Bluher, 56, at the Bel-Air Bay Club on April 9—and when it came to picking her dress, she went in blind … literally!</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=400 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Taylor Armstrong and Kyle Richards Wedding" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>After getting stressed over previous designs, Armstrong said she tried on the gown blindfolded. “I ended up having to try it on blindfolded, because they didn’t want me to see it,” Armstrong told Us. “So at my first fitting they had me blindfolded … It was not finished until three hours before the wedding. I saw it and put it on and literally walked down the aisle.”</p><p>As for her wedding guests, the second-time bride, who televised the event for WE TV, invited her former RHOBH costars <strong>Kyle Richards</strong>,<strong> Kim Richards</strong>, <strong>Adrienne Maloof</strong>, <strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong> and friend <strong>Faye Resnick</strong>, along with their husbands and Maloof’s ex, <strong>Paul</strong>. However, Armstrong decided to seat them all at separate tables. (<strong>Camille Grammer</strong>, <strong>Yolanda </strong>and <strong>David Foster </strong>were invited but couldn’t attend because they were out of town; <strong>Brandi Glanville</strong> was the sole RHOBH costar not invited to the nuptials.)</p><p>“Because it was during the reunion [special] and I didn’t know, that was week to week because the seating chart was one of the most complicated things,” the former reality star explained, “I separated everyone.” Two cohorts she did have at the same table, naturally, were sisters Kim and Kyle Richards. But, in true fashion, Armstrong reveals Kim was a no-show. “I wasn’t even mad, I just had to laugh,” Armstrong admitted of Kim, whose flakiness was well documented on RHOBH. “I just thought it was hysterical because of course, Kim.”</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Before they were </a><a href=#>Real Housewives</a>&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=464 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Taylor Armstrong, John Bluher and Kennedy Wedding" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br></p><p>Another crucial element of the wedding was her 8-year-old daughter, <strong>Kennedy</strong>. As Bluher announced at the reception, he is in the stages of adopting Kennedy as his own. When it comes to Kennedy’s late biological father, <strong>Russell Armstrong</strong>, who committed suicide in August 2011, Armstrong explained her daughter “doesn’t have a lot of memories because she was [only] five-and-a-half” at the time of Russell’s tragic death.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But Kennedy is aware, her mom said, that Russell took his own life. Armstrong reveals she took her daughter to see a psychologist and explained that Russell had a “sickness.” “I think she does maybe know that he took his life and it probably happened just because there was so much talk about it,” she added. “Whether it was her overhearing something … but I get the impression that she knows it was by his own hands. Really, that was something that I preferred for her not to know until she was much older.”</p><p>Coming out on the other side, Armstrong now says she feels “incredibly lucky” and is looking to move back to Los Angeles. (The couple currently reside in Vail, Colorado.)</p><p>Armstrong, who appeared on VH-1’s Couples Therapy after Housewives, added she’d like to try out scripted television. “I’ve auditioned for some scripted things. I don’t know that they were the perfect role, but I’m just trying to get that under my belt, because it’s new for me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN5wKukrKyipLuoedOao6SrXZ28uHnHnqlmnJGqtKnAxKtkrqaUmr%2B0wMCnm6xloqrAtLHLpapmnJWWwal5kWlobXBlZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./category-pok-c3-a9mon-chronicles-episodes.html>&#171;&nbsp;Category:Pokmon Chronicles episodes - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a>
