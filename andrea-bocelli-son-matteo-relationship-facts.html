Much of which has been kept apart from his professional persona. Of course, Andrea Bocelli's music is nothing short of legendary. Few artists in his genre have reached the type of international success that he has. But that hasn't taken away from his family life. In fact, it actually enhances it. But more on that later.</p><p>Andrea Bocelli has three kids. Two from his first marriage to Enrica Cenzatti, and one from his second to Veronica Berti.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Italian Opera Singer, Andrea Bocelli's Incredible Life And Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amos and Matteo were born to Cenzatti in 1995 and 1997 respectively. His daughter, Virginia, was born in 2012 to his second wife and manager Veronica Berti.</p><h2 id=inside-andrea-bocelli-39-s-relationship-with-matteo>Inside Andrea Bocelli's Relationship With Matteo?</h2><p>It seems like every one of Andrea Bocelli's kids is gifted musically. His eldest son, Amos, has been featured on some of his albums playing the piano. And then there's Matteo and Virginia who both have absolutely incredible voices. This isn't lost on the acclaimed tenor. In fact, he has made multiple albums with each of his kids as well as featured them in his concerts. Musical collaboration is clearly something he values as it brings them all together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A quick look at Matteo's Instagram profile will show that he's already very much made a career out of the gifts his father has no doubt given him. According to People, he has been singing since he was very young. While it took him time to work up the courage to sing for his father, he explained that he's been studying the craft under him for years. And, of course, his father is the one who encouraged him to dive into music in the first place.</p><p>"My father the first time said, 'Why don't you start playing the piano now just to see if you like it?' So I started and at the beginning, when you're younger, you want to resist your parents — with this case it would be my dad. But then, with years, I really appreciated the subject that I was studying," Matteo said to People.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Dr. Phil’s Sons Actually Think About Their Father’s Controversial Career</a></span></p><p>There's no doubt that Matteo's first big break in the music industry was the single, "Fall On Me", which feature both he and his father.</p><p>"Fall On Me" was featured on both the soundtrack and in the final film for the 2018 Disney blockbuster, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms. But the Italian version, "Ven a MI" was part of Bocelli's album "Sì"</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to People</a>, Andrea Bocelli wanted "Fall On Me" to be the gateway to Matteo's success. Not only as his collaborator but also as a solo singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Tiger Woods And Elin Nordegren's Relationship With Son Charlie Axel</a></span></p><p>"I hope very much that this would be a first step for Matteo along many steps in his career, but my hope for him especially is that he stays who he is, that he remains anchored to the values that he grew up with in our family and does not fall into the traps that many have fallen into," Andrea Bocelli said to People of the success that "Fall On Me" has brought his son. "I would never forgive myself for this debut if that happened. You have to stay modest and humble."</p><p>Andrea Bocelli's worry about his son finding too much success too soon was the reason he originally didn't want him to participate in "Fall On Me".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He was not in my plans — I actually didn't want him to participate in the recordings, because I believe he needs to finish his studies at the conservatory," Bocelli said of his son at the time. "But we had a great opportunity, and we took it because it was a great song. But it doesn't mean in any way that he's arrived!"</p><p>Once the producers of "Fall On Me" caught on to the incredible and loving dynamic between father and son, they changed the tone to reflect the magic happening between the two singers.</p><p>While Andrea Bocelli has noted the musical differences between them, he told People that Matteo was "born with" an incredible musical ability. And this is something Andrea has encouraged his son to develop and pursue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5yimq5urs6cnKWkmWLAsLqMppitrJWkerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIyfmJyso2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./brittany-mahomes.html>&#171;&nbsp;Brittany Mahomes wikipedia.
