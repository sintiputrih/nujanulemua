She got her start in 1987 at the age of 14, working on My Pet Monster. Since then she has lent her vocal talents to hundreds of characters in every genre, using her unique ability to bend her voice to create different styles and sounds. Unfortunately her voice may have gotten her into some hot water.</p><p>Tara was recast from the independent animated show Boxtown, and fans speculate that it may have something to do with a series of tweets about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On Oct. 7, 2023, the terrorist organization Hamas attacked attendees of a music festival in Israel. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a> reported more than 260 people have since died, which prompted a response from Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. What did Tara Strong say about this? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>JULY 22: Tara Strong visits the #IMDboat official portrait studio at San Diego Comic-Con 2022</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did Tara Strong say?</h2><p>Tara, who is Jewish, immediately took to social media after the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">October 7 attack to post</a>, "If you are PRO suffering, r---, murder of ANY innocent people, today I will block you. We should all be praying for peace. To end ALL wars, near and far. To end the suffering of ALL innocent civilians everywhere regardless of political affiliation."</p><p>The day after the attack, Tara <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted a message from the American Jewish Committee</a> that claimed people "only excuse terror when it targets Israel." She added, "Because everyone hates Jews." In the replies someone said, "Hi I'm Jewish! Being pro Palestine does not make you antisemitic," to which Tara responded, "You can want to help Palestine without supporting terrorism."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is only the beginning.

"Islam is a real, clear, and present danger," it said. "Islamaphobia has been debunked vehemently." The date of the original tweet is Oct. 10 and two days later, the Boxtown Twitter account announced Tara was being recast.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tara Strong claims she was fired for being Jewish.</h2><p>"Hello all! Just wanted to offer a quick update on Boxtown. We will be recasting the role of Bill (previously played by Tara Strong). We’ll have more info soon on open auditions," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they wrote in their tweet</a>. Tara found out she was no longer playing this part, via their tweet. "This is what happens when you help fans get shows made I guess," she said, "Fired for being Jewish. Glad I helped you get your kickstarter money.

"The Boxtown team is a diverse team of all stripes," it said. "Ms. Strong was fully paid for her work (and as we're only funded for one episode, she is missing out on no future work). It's very disappointing that some people continue to spread misinformation and hatred. We do not stand for hatred in any of its forms."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydoJ1lpJa%2FonnSramoppdiwKLF</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-american-comedian-and-actress-nikki-glaser-married-to-everything-about-her-love-and-marital-life.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is American Comedian And Actress Nikki Glaser Married To?
