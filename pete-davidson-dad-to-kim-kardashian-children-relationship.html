Davidson And Kim Kardashian Get Back Together?</a></li></ul><p>For the better part of a year, Pete Davidson and <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> formed an unlikely yet insanely popular relationship. Despite their age gap, they seemed to have a real connection that a lot of Hollywood couples don't normally have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, their love affair just didn't work out. There were numerous factors that amounted to them giving up on their relationship. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">age difference between them</a> was an important one for sure, but they had a group of other things working against them. Kanye West's public vendetta against both Kim and Pete certainly drove the two apart. Kim even had to get a <a href=#>restraining order</a> against Kanye at one point during their relationship, which certainly was a huge distraction from Kim and Pete's newfound love.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Kim Kardashian's Net Worth Taking A Hit Following Her Divorce Settlement From Kanye West?</a></span></p><p>In the meantime, Pete's <a href=#>gotten comfortable</a> with supermodel Emily Ratajkowski. Not much has been reflected on regarding his relationship with Kim, but some people still wonder about Pete's relationship with Kim's kids. It was shown on social media that they had so much fun together, and he even <a href=#>got tattoos</a> based around Kim's kids. How would he have truly felt about the prospect of being a stepdad?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-pete-davidson-feel-about-potentially-being-a-stepdad>How Did Pete Davidson Feel About Potentially Being A Stepdad?</h2><p>To anyone paying attention to the situation, it was pretty obvious that Pete would have loved being a stepfather to Kim's kids.</p><p>Pete and Kim's kids <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spent a lot of time</a> together, but there was a lot of preparation that happened before they met each other.</p><p>Kim was very conscious of how her divorce from Kanye could affect her kids, so she planned ahead of Pete meeting her children. According to an interview Kim did with the Today show, she revealed that she consulted with therapists before the kids met Pete. She also waited for her and Pete's relationship to get serious, too. Then, Pete and Kim's kids actually met. It's safe to say they definitely got along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Pete never publicly said anything about Kim's kids, some rumors from an important source can definitely tell a story. According to People, a source close to Kim said that both Kim and Pete were planning on having kids together. That source also claimed that Pete "loved having the kids around". There's also the tattoos that Pete got on his neck that spell the initials of Kim's four kids.</p><p>Combining all of that with the heavy rumors that Kim and Pete were planning on settling down for something long-term, it's likely that Pete wondered what it would be like to be the stepdad of Kim's kids. Given the fact that he loved her kids and her kids loved him, Pete probably loved the idea of becoming a permanent part of their family.</p><h2 id=how-did-kim-kardashian-39-s-kids-feel-about-pete-davidson>How Did Kim Kardashian's Kids Feel About Pete Davidson?</h2><p>As was previously stated, Kim's kids definitely felt positive about Pete. What exactly did they say, though?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete had the most public relationship with Kim's oldest child North West. This isn't a hard reason to figure out, as North is the most famous of Kim's children so far.</p><p>The first thing released regarding Pete and North was a video taken by TMZ that showed Pete and North driving in the same electric car, with North seated on Pete's lap. This footage also further showed Pete's relationship with Kim's family, as this was a fun, relaxing day hanging out with Kourtney Kardashian's family.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Little Known Secrets From Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidsonâs Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pictures that were taken of Pete and Saint West were quite troubling after Kanye found out about them. Saint was six when these pictures were taken by the paparazzi on Pete and Saint's day out together, and according to Entertainment Tonight, wasn't "pleased" with Kim and Pete for this. He reached out to Kim behind the scenes, and the two had discussions about repairing their relationship. Once again, the same source that reported about Kanye's outrage also reported that the kids "love" Pete.</p><p>Kim's other kids are younger, but according to almost all the sources close to Kim, they seemed to really enjoy being around Pete.</p><h2 id=will-pete-davidson-and-kim-kardashian-get-back-together>Will Pete Davidson And Kim Kardashian Get Back Together?</h2><p>So, Pete liked being around Kim's kids, and Kim's kids enjoyed being around Pete. Kim and Pete seemed to enjoy each other's company, so will they ever get back together?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As time goes by, the answer to that question seems unlikely.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Pete and Kim didn't end in disaster. It ended because of an age difference and a messy divorce, two barriers that were tough when combined. Since then, Pete's already moved on to a relationship with supermodel Emily Ratajkowski. While Pete's relationship with Emily may have just started, it's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">already getting serious</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Of Pete Davidsonâs Ex-Girlfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, Kim is still single. According to Glamour, Kim is "happily" single and doesn't want to see anybody right now. This would include Kanye and Pete, two people she probably just wants to move on from.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinnqyVYrGiwsidqqimXZmupXnTqGSkoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo3qktMilm6udnmK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./mark-king.html>&#171;&nbsp;Mark King</a>
