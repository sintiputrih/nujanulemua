Fans of a very popular franchise in the early 2000s may remember who Sabara is, but he appears to have taken a step away from the spotlight in recent years. So, what exactly has he been doing?</p><h2 id=how-did-meghan-trainor-and-daryl-sabara-meet>How Did Meghan Trainor And Daryl Sabara Meet?</h2><p>Singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor is probably best known for her hit track, All About That Bass, which catapulted her into stardom. After several years of not consistently releasing music, she made a big return in 2022 with popular songs like Made You Look. So, what was she doing in the time in between? Well, her love life has been pretty eventful, and in 2018, she married Daryl Sabara.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Meghan Trainor Has Been Up To Since Her Hit Song 'All About That Bass'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair actually met four years earlier at a party and later went on a double date with Chloë Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Beckham (back when they were dating because <a href=#>Beckham is now married to Nicola Peltz</a>. Trainor reflected on this date in an interview with <a href=#>Chelsea Handler for her Netflix series</a> in 2016 (via Yahoo!).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/th-image-template-3-3.jpg><p>"I asked every person I met since day one, 'Find me a boyfriend!' Like, especially new friends too. Chloë Grace Moretz is a friend of mine, and day one of meeting her, I was like, 'You know anybody that I could date? Or love? Whatever,'" she said.</p><p>So, Trainor and Sabara actually have Moretz to thank. Yahoo notes that Trainor and Sabara dated for a year before getting engaged.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/daryl-sabara-and-meghan-trainor-1.jpg><p>In 2021, they welcomed their first child, a son named Riley, and appear to be very happy together. In January 2023, she also announced a second pregnancy. Trainor actually has a tendency to overshare when it comes to their personal life, even giving <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">private details about their bedroom activities</a>.</p><p>For example, she said she couldn't do it while she was pregnant. In 2023, she shared more information on ​​her Workin' On It podcast, discussing how Sabara is a "big boy."

In 2021, she gave an interview on the Why Won't You Date Me? podcast and addressed her relationship.</p><p>"The best part about my relationship is that Daryl — he cares so much about me, my well-being, my emotional state, my physical, everything," she said.

In the franchise, he played the role of Juni Cortez.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/daryl-sabara-and-meghan-trainor-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sabara also has an impressive net worth. Celebrity Net Worth estimates it to be $5 million. But has he done anything since childhood?</p><p>His career has been slower since his days as a child star, but he has continued to work in the entertainment industry. He became a voice actor, with his credits including voicing a character on the TV movie Ben 10 vs. the Universe: The Movie in 2020, and the Ben 10 video game that same year. He is also credited with voice acting on the 2019 animation film, Bongee Bear and the Kingdom of Rhythm.</p><p>Fans would have most recently seen him in the music video for Trainor's track, Made You Look. This is not their first collaboration on her music videos either, and he has also been involved in Marry Me and Foolish.</p><h2 id=what-is-daryl-sabara-doing-now>What Is Daryl Sabara Doing Now?</h2><p>Daryl Sabara has a loving wife and will soon be a father of two, but he has been honest about things not always being easy for him. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He has struggled with sobriety</a>, something which he has spoken about during Meghan Trainor's podcast Workin' On It, in a 2023 episode (via People).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Meghan Trainor Has Some Surprising Songwriting Credits Outside Her Own Albums</a></span></p><p>"One piece of advice that my therapist gave me that was so helpful was [that] she just said, 'If you want to be on your A-game maybe consider full sobriety,'" he said. "I was like, 'what the f***! Of course, I want to be on my A-game. That really sparked something in me to go like, 'OK, you know what? Even though weeds not really bad for me right now, I don't need to keep testing it out to wait to get bad or to get in a bad spot. So let's just try this full sobriety thing."</p><p>Therapy has helped him to change his outlook and adopt a healthier lifestyle. He is also able to determine what some of his triggers are, and this includes "being alone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The process has not been easy, and giving up all substances has been a challenge for him. But he also has the support of his wife, who he claims makes him a better person. In the podcast, he told her, "You just make me a better person, and I appreciate you."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/daryl-sabara-and-meghan-trainor-3.jpg><p>As for what is in their future, regarding work? We cannot be sure, but Sabara seems to enjoy his transition to voice acting, and Trainor is a woman who was born to be in the limelight, either with her music, a podcast, or something else. We don't expect her to disappear from the spotlight anytime soon. They also appear to be incredibly happy together, and <a href=#>maybe more babies are in their future</a>?!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqqpoXq0rcGaqZplnprBbsPOq6uhZZ2atKmtzWarq5mZo7yzeceuqpuZnpl6uLTArWShmaClsq%2Bxw2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./patrick-ryan-jr-prj-long-sleeve-tee.html>&#171;&nbsp;Patrick Ryan Jr. PRJ Long Sleeve Tee</a>
