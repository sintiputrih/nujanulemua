Kirk was reelected mayor of Dallas with 74% of the vote in 1999.&nbsp;One incident occurred in the campaign: a radio campaign ad used Star Trek music and called Kirk the “captain” of the Dallas Enterprise. It cited the city’s bond program and the new sports arena as well as new roads.&nbsp;Paramount lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to the advertiser.</p><p>During his tenure as mayor, Kirk earned the reputation of being a coalition-builder, managing to keep the always-tumultuous Dallas City Council and Dallas School Board together. Under his leadership, he proposed the “Dallas Plan”, a vision for the next 25 years, which included the controversial Trinity River Project, a $246 million plan that called for constructing a network of parks and privately owned toll roads in the flood plain of the Trinity River. He also pushed the construction of the American Airlines Center, whose opening he oversaw in 2002.</p><p>As a supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), his selection drew criticism from opponents of free trade policies. His nomination ran into further controversy when it was revealed that he owed $9,975 in back taxes. As compensation for speeches he gave from 2004 to the present, he had $37,750 of payments made directly to a scholarship fund at Austin College. Kirk should have included the $37,750 payments with his gross income and then claimed a charitable deduction for the same amount. Kirk also claimed deductions for three years of season tickets to the Dallas Mavericks as qualifying entertainment expenses. In order to claim a qualifying entertainment expense, the Internal Revenue Service requires written documentation of the time, place, business purpose, name, and business relationship of the person being entertained, records that Kirk did not keep for almost half of the basketball games. Kirk’s deductions for tax and accounting fees were also too large.</p><p align=justify>Kirk was born in Austin, Texas. He is a graduate of Austin’s John H. Reagan High School and Austin College.&nbsp;Kirk was Secretary of Texas from 1994 to 1995. He was elected Mayor of Dallas in 2002. He was the first African American to hold these positions.&nbsp;In 2002, he ran for the United States Senate but was defeated by John Cornyn, his Republican opponent.&nbsp;Kirk was a partner in the Houston-based law company Vinson & Elkins, and a lobbyist for Energy Future Holdings (and Merrill Lynch) after his defeat.</p><p align=justify>Kirk was Secretary of State for Texas in 1994 as Secretary of Texas for Governor Ann Richards.&nbsp;Kirk ran for Dallas mayor in the following year.&nbsp;Kirk won 62 percent of all votes in 1995, thanks to the support of Dallas’ African American community and the Dallas business community.</p><p align=justify>In 2002, Kirk resigned as mayor of Dallas in order to run for the Senate seat vacated by retiring Republican Phil Gramm. Facing then-Texas Attorney General John Cornyn; Kirk lost with 43 percent of the vote to Cornyn’s 55 percent.</p><h2>Ron Kirk Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ron is one of the <strong>richest Lawyer</strong> from United States.

On January 22, 2013, Kirk announced that he would be stepping down as U.S. Trade Rep.</p><p>In May 2012, a group of 30 legal scholars, critical of the USTR’s “biased and closed” Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) treaty negotiation process and proposed intellectual property-related provisions, publicly called upon Kirk to uphold democratic ideals by reversing the “dialing back” of stakeholder participation and to release negotiating texts for public scrutiny. The law professors claimed that leaked documents show that the USTR is “pushing numerous standards that […] could require changes in current U.S. statutory law” and that the proposal is “manifestly unbalanced—it predominantly proposes increases in proprietor rights, with no effort to expand the limitations and exceptions to such rights that are needed in the U.S. and abroad to serve the public interest”. The group claimed that the negotiations excluded stakeholders such as “consumers, libraries, students, health advocacy or patient groups, or others users of intellectual property” and that it only offered “minimal representation of other affected businesses, such as generic drug manufacturers or Internet service providers”.</p><h2>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h2><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ron Kirk ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He was briefly a candidate for chairman of the Democratic National Committee after the 2004 election. Later he was a partner with the Houston-based law firm Vinson and Elkins, where, according to Texans for Public Justice, he was, as of March 2007, one of the four highest paid lobbyists for Energy Future Holdings Corporation.</p><p align=justify>This prompted further criticism from the academic group that free-trade agreement negotiations, notorious for their secrecy, are “the wrong standard for assessing the legitimacy of the TPP intellectual property chapter negotiations. This is because the IP chapter in the TPP, like ACTA, is not a trade agreement. It does not adjust tariffs and quotas—it sets new international limits on domestic regulation, regardless of whether such regulation discriminates against, or even affects, trade”. The group further reiterated its claim that the secretive process is antithetical to the ideals of democracy, and is “no way to engender trust and faith in international law making with such a broad impact”. One critic pointed out that despite Kirk’s claim of transparency in the process, public-interest stakeholders have been completely excluded. Another accused Kirk of sidestepping the issue of transparency, and pointed out that transparency is less about the degree of public input, and more about “the flow of information the other way—information about the workings of government being visible to the people it is supposed to represent”.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Ron Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Lawyer</strong>.
