Meet Belinda Bencic Parents: Relationship &amp;amp; Family</h1><div id=sub-header>January 2024 · 3 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Belinda Bencic </strong>is a professional tennis player from Switzerland. She is the daughter of <strong>Ivan and Daniela Bencic</strong>. The athlete’s father and mother had a significant part in her unrivaled and incredible career. Belinda’s father, Ivan, has even dedicated his days to teaching and converting her into one of the top female tennis players in the world.</p><p>Furthermore, the athlete’s biological mother’s contribution to her upbringing is equal to her father’s. Her youth was spent in Flawil, Switzerland, with her parents and only brother, Brian Bencic.&nbsp;Belinda’s career has included a successful adventure. She made history by beginning to play tennis at the age of two and became the first Swiss athlete to win a gold medal in Women’s Singles at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p><p>Furthermore, on February 17, 2020, the tennis player was rated “Number 4” As of right now, this is her career-high ranking.&nbsp;Not only has Belinda left her mark on tennis history, but she has also amassed a sizable fortune from her job. Whether it was the prize money or her typical wage, it all added up to her outstanding net worth of $6 million as of 2023.</p><h2>Belinda Bencic Parents: Ivan And Daniela Bencic</h2><p>Belinda was born on March 10, 1997, in Flawil, Switzerland to her father, Ivan, and mother, Daniela.&nbsp;Ivan, her father, was a professional hockey player in the Swiss National League A and National League B.&nbsp;Ivan then worked as an Insurance Broker before becoming a full-time coach. Belinda’s mother, Daniela, on the other hand, used to be a high-level handball player.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Belinda-Bencic-1.jpg alt="Belinda Bencic" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Because both of Belinda’s parents are athletes, it seemed inevitable that she would pursue an athletic career as well. Brian, her younger brother, was also a professional tennis player who participated on the ATP Tour and served as a coach from March 2020 until June 2021.&nbsp;However, he settled down to be the Insurance and Pension Advisor at Generali in the middle of 2021.</p><h2>Ivan Bencic has always been a fan of Belinda Bencic</h2><p>Ivan, Belinda’s father, has had a significant influence on her life. Her father started her tennis when she was two years old. Ivan aspired for her to be as proficient as Martina Hingis, the world’s number-one tennis player at the time. As a result, he arranged for her to attend a training session with Hingis’s mother and the instructor, Melanie Molitor.&nbsp;Belinda won the two junior Grand Slam Single championships at Wimbledon and the French Open at the age of 16 because of consistent and persistent work.</p><p>She eventually started her professional career in the 2014 US Open, when she became the second-youngest quarterfinalist after Martini Hingis in 1997.&nbsp;Later in her career, Belinda succeeded in the sport, setting several records, including gold (singles) and silver (doubles) in the 2020 Olympics. Belinda would not have been able to achieve such success without the help of her father.&nbsp;Not to mention that Ivan has been her daughter’s coach for many years.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Belinda-Bencic-2.jpg alt="Belinda Bencic" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Belinda Bencic’s Personal Life</h2><p>Belinda, a professional tennis player, is in a committed relationship with her partner, <strong>Martin Hromkovic</strong>.&nbsp;They allegedly met in 2017 at Empire Tennis Academy and began dating in 2018.&nbsp;Martin, who was born on May 27, 1982, began playing professional soccer at the age of 20. The retired soccer player played for OFC Russel Gabkovo throughout most of his professional career.</p><p>The native of Slovakia has a master’s degree from Univerzita Komenskeho’s Fakulta Telesne Vychovy A Sportu and works as a strength and conditioning coach.&nbsp;Martin also worked as a personal trainer for his girlfriend.&nbsp;Belinda formerly dated Russian tennis star Alexander Zverev.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecivmKdlkaOxbrDAp6CepJFir6a6wqKaZqWVmsFursSloKeckWKvprrCoppmqJGnsq%2FA0mapnqSRqbawutKhoKlllpa6qrjYaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chris-mullin-net-worth-262307.html>&#171;&nbsp;Chris Mullin Net Worth 2024</a>
