But, when Adam Drexler came through “the portal” she ended up saying, “I knew right away that you were special, and you have shown me so much about myself and about the way that I want to become a better person for you”.</p><p>When we first met Allyssa, she was a self-assured model who openly confessed she was more than eager to meet her true love, get married, and possibly have a kid soon. She was actually on the verge of abandoning this project after her disappointing encounter with Nelson, her awkward meeting with Travis, and the unexpected (momentary) entrance of her fan Daniel.</p><p>Allyssa is one of the six single people who joined the new experiment to find the love of her life. She resorted to “The One That Got Away” because she claimed that she had never fallen in love or found the one in her life.</p><p>Learn more about her journey, her job, her age, and her social media reach. Keep reading to learn more about her.</p><h3><strong>One That Got Away: Are Allyssa Anderson And Adam Drexler Still Together?</strong></h3><p>A well-known professional athlete and the son of the Basketball Hall of Famer Clyde Drexler, Adam Drexler, entered the picture at that point and managed to sweep her off her feet, permanently altering her perspective.</p><p>While in high school, Allyssa mistakenly believed that Adam never paid attention to her. In reality, he had shut several doors in order to focus on basketball full-time. The man, who was then 27 years old, really acknowledged that he had always been aware of her generosity and the combination of her beauty and intelligence and had felt drawn to her aura, but he had never taken any action. Thus, his appearance ultimately prevented her from pursuing a relationship with fellow cast member Dylan Palladino, a relic from Kasey Ma’s past, and eventually led her to quit leading on Travis.</p><p>Allyssa and Adam went on their first date to a private prom, which was a first for her, and he showed that he had been desiring to know her better and more romantically for over ten years. He showed her that he was looking at her in a way that she couldn’t even understand as a teen by asking all the appropriate questions in addition to complimenting her for the right reasons and asking the correct questions.</p><p>They easily talked about everything, from their goals to their ideals to the value of a strong support system for their families, so it wasn’t a surprise when they departed hand in hand.</p><p>Allyssa didn’t let her college crush Jeff into their relationship because she had gradually come to recognize that Adam brings out the best in her in every aspect. When it came time to return to the real world, Adam got down on one knee to propose to her after gaining her parents’ blessing and knowing she earned it.</p><p>He said, “Allyssa, this is a promise to you that no matter what happens and no matter where life takes us, I’m always going to support you; I’m always going to be there for you. This is a promise that I’m going to keep on falling for you after we leave this place together”.</p><p>But the question remains, are they still together?</p><p>According to Allyssa’s Facebook account, she is single. This means things didn’t work out between the two and they are no longer together in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Allyssa Anderson Age</strong></h3><p>1995 is the reported birth year of Allyssa Anderson.
